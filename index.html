<h1>Drawing Without Images</h1>
<p>The point of this engine is to not use textures, sprites,
<p>images at all. Instead, you can draw on the screen using
<p>built-in functions. In this example game, you can press
<p>any key to do a script.</p>
<p/>
Here are the list of scripts you can do:
draw_one(x,y,r,g,b) Draws one colored pixel.
draw_two(x1,y1,r1,g1,b1,x2,y2,r2,g2,b2) Draws two colored pixels.
draw_three(x1,y1,r1,g1,b1,x2,y2,r2,g2,b2,x3,y3,r3,g3,b3) Draws three colored pixels.
clear() Clears pixels and entire screen.
