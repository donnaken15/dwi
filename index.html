<title>DWI - Drawing Without Images</title>
<h1>DWI</h1>
<p>The point of this engine is to not use textures, sprites,
<p>images at all. Instead, you can draw on the screen using
<p>built-in functions. In this example game, you can press
<p>any key to do a script.</p>
<p>
<p>Here are the list of scripts you can do:
<p>draw_one(x,y,r,g,b) Draws one colored pixel.
<p>draw_two(x1,y1,r1,g1,b1,x2,y2,r2,g2,b2) Draws two colored pixels.
<p>draw_three(x1,y1,r1,g1,b1,x2,y2,r2,g2,b2,x3,y3,r3,g3,b3) Draws three colored pixels.
<p>clear() Clears pixels and entire screen.
<p>
<p>Runs on GameMaker 8.1
